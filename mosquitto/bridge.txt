A small reminder on how to test bridges with mosquitto.

* Bridge configuration

File: `mosquitto_bridge.conf`.
Important part to configure:

  connection bridge
  address 192.168.1.14:1883
  topic d/# out 1
  topic d/# in 1
  topic s/ping in 1


* Launch

  # Main broker (listen on 1883):
  mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
  # Bridge broker (listen on 1884):
  moquitto -c mosquitto_bridge.conf
  ./device 1 tcp://localhost:1883
  ./service 100 tcp://localhost:1884
  mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t 's/#'
  # The following should not display anything as the bridge doesn't
  # forward topics s/#
  mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1884 -t 's/#'
